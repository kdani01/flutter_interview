flutter project for kadasolutions interview

important information:
- I'm still practicing to commit smaller parts of my code change,
    this is why it is changing in length so much.

- I left some comments int the code for better understandment,
    and some for extra information on deciding to do - or not do - something in a way written there.

- I was thiking about using internationalization, because your company works with other companies in Switzerland,
    but only a few words were not dynamic, so it seemed an overkill for this project. I would use it in real projects.

- I'm using static values instead of Riverpod to access some values globally,
    but I would use Riverpod, if the two other pages also needed to be implemented.
